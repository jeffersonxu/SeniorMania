# SeniorMania

My high school has a tradition where the senior class competes with one another in teams to complete a multitude of "bucket list" with tasks ranging from team selfies in a porta potty to other various quirky challenges.
This was a website I made built with just vanilla JS and Firebase to help teams keep score of their points and various challenges they have completed throughout the year.

Feel free to take a peek [here](https://seniormania.fun "Senior Mania Site") :)

Login in using **grazwe19@bergen.org** and **mitochondria123** to see functionality. Don't worry about breaking the firebase as all write rules are set to false.
