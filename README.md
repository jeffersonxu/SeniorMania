# SeniorMania

My high school has a fun tradition where the senior class competes with one another in teams to complete a multitude of "bucket list" with tasks ranging from team selfies in a porta potty to other various quirky challenges.
This was a website I made built with just vanilla JS and Firebase to help teams keep score of their points and various challenges they have completed throughout the year.

## Setup

Feel free to take a peek  :)

Login in using **grazwe19@bergen.org** and **mitochondria123** to at [https://seniormania.fun](https://seniormania.fun "Senior Mania Site"). Don't worry about breaking the database as all write rules are set to false.

If you want to run it locally, clone the repo and run the following commands.
```
npm install
firebase init
```
Message me personally for the API Key or change the config variables in app.js to match your firebase credentials.
